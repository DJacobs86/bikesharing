# NYC's Citibike Exploration with Tableau

# Project Overview
In New York City, Citi Bank and Lyft offers a program called Citibike, It is a low cost and environmentally friendly option to travel around the city. A subscruption is offerd at $16 a month or a single ride is offered at $4, a Citibike user can ride classic and electric bikes around the city.There is an interest in starting a similar bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. Tableau has been used to produce some beautiful visualizations to show the investors and later the team of researchers, budget analysts, and advertisers.

## Purpose
In these visualizations data for New York City will be shown but will ideally present a good case for starting a bikesharing company in Des Moines. Creating a story will add a complete, meaningful, easy to read, and professional feel to the Citibike data, which will help our presentation to major stakeholders.

## Summary
New York City and Des Moines, Iowa are definitely not identical cities, but there are several things we can declare from this project. Citibike has found success in NYC by offering bikes at a low cost and at several readily available access points in the city. Des Moines could see similar success if several points are considered:

- Citibikes are popular for users that are looking for a ride for less than an hour - this could help workers in Des Moines
- Citibike in NYC has loyal subscribers who use the service consistently and often
- Customers tend to use Citibikes for longer durations than subscribers
- In NYC, Citibikes are popular among males - but this trend may not be perfectly replicated in a smaller, safer city
- There is a consistent and stable community-wide need for Citibikes as males and females use Citibikes on the same day.days, suggesting stable and consistent community-wide need
