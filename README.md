# NYC's Citibike Exploration with Tableau

# Project Overview
In New York City, Citi Bank and Lyft offers a program called Citibike, It is a low cost and environmentally friendly option to travel around the city. A subscruption is offerd at $16 a month or a single ride is offered at $4, a Citibike user can ride classic and electric bikes around the city.There is an interest in starting a similar bikesharing company in Des Moines, Iowa. Tableau has been used to produce some beautiful visualizations to show the investors and later the team of researchers, budget analysts, and advertisers.

## Purpose
In these visualizations data for New York City will be shown but will ideally present a good case for starting a bikesharing company in Des Moines. Creating a story will add a complete, meaningful, easy to read, and professional feel to the Citibike data, which will help our presentation to major stakeholders.
